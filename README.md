# Loan Predictor
This is a Data Mining project for the course of *Computational Learning*. The goal is to use existing data of a bank to identify good and bad clients, as well as to predict if a loan would be paid back.

To do so, we've followed the steps of the CRISP-DM methodology: *Business Understanding*, *Data Understanding*, *Data Preparation*, *Modeling*, *Evaluation*, and *Deployment*.

Several models were tested and compared. Furthermore, we've experimented a lot of different techniques of Data Understanding, Preparation, Modeling and Evaluation.

## Results
The best model and parameters yielded an AUC-ROC score of 95.1%

The work done is described in detail in the [final report](./docs/report_g69.pdf).
